        "Each assignment is structured as a Jupyter notebook, offering interactive tutorials that align with our lectures. You will encounter two types of problems: *write-up problems* and *coding problems*.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Write-up Problems:** These problems are primarily theoretical, requiring you to demonstrate your understanding of lecture concepts and to provide mathematical proofs for key theorems. Your answers should include sufficient steps for the mathematical derivations.\n",
        "2. **Coding Problems:** Here, you will be engaging with practical coding tasks. These may involve completing code segments provided in the notebooks or developing models from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure clarity and consistency in your submissions, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
        "\n",
        "* For write-up problems, use Markdown bullet points to format text answers. Also, express all mathematical equations using $\\LaTeX$ and avoid plain text such as `x0`, `x^1`, or `R x Q` for equations.\n",
        "* For coding problems, comment on your code thoroughly for readability and ensure your code is executable. Non-runnable code may lead to a loss of **all** points. Coding problems have automated grading, and altering the grading code will result in a deduction of **all** points.\n",
        "* Your submission should show the entire process of data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, and result analysis. This can be achieved through a mix of explanatory text cells, inline comments, intermediate result displays, and experimental visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Submission Requirements\n",
        "\n",
        "* Submit your solutions through GradeScope in BruinLearn.\n",
        "* Late submissions are allowed up to 24 hours post-deadline with a penalty factor of $\\mathbf{1}(t\\leq24)e^{-(\\ln(2)/12)t}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Collaboration and Integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "* Collaboration is encouraged, but all final submissions must be your own work. Please acknowledge any collaboration or external sources used, including websites, papers, and GitHub repositories.\n",
        "* Any suspicious cases of academic misconduct will be reported to The Office of the Dean of Students.\n",

In practice, the Adam optimizer is a good choice for many tasks, while SGD can lead to better convergence in some cases. However, the choice of learning rate can be more tricky. In general, a learning rate that is too small will lead to slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large will lead to divergence. In this exercise, you can use the default learning rate of 0.01. However, you are encouraged to experiment with different optimizers and/or learning rates and observe the impact on the training process.\n",

The choice of distribution from which these negative samples are drawn can significantly affect the quality of the learned embeddings.\n",

        "- Subsampling of Frequent Words: Modify the frequency-based distribution to reduce the representation of extremely frequent words. This can help in reducing the bias towards very common words in the corpus.\n",
        "- Custom Distribution based on Part-of-Speech Tags: Create a distribution where the probability of a word being sampled as negative depends on its [part-of-speech tag](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html). For instance, you might choose to sample nouns or verbs more frequently.\n",
        "- Contextual Similarity-Based Distribution: Develop a distribution that takes into account the similarity of words to the target word. Words that are contextually similar to the target word could have a lower probability of being selected as negative samples.\n",

You can reuse the `train_with_neg_sampling` function to train the model with different negative sampling distributions.

        "- Corpus-Specific Distributions: Tailor the negative sampling distribution to the specific characteristics of the corpus you are using (e.g., technical vs. general language).\n",
